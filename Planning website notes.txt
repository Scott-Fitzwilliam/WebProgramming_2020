onclick functions will be need to create and remove elements

when a task is create a button needs to be created to remove it.

another button needs to be created which can say the task is completed, which for now will make it cyan

to give onclick functionality to the created divs, you can make a function for 

myNewElement.onclick = function()
{

}

all of the elemetns withing the first onclick only exist in the onclick, to reference else where, we need to create an array that recieves a reference from it.



let myNewElementArray = []

to add to array
myNewElementArray.push(myNewElement);
to show that the array is expanding
console.log(myNewElementArray);

when using the array, whenever, a change event happens such as adding or removing, the the array needs to do the same to be accurate.

myNewElementArray


doSomethingButton.onmouseover = function(){
myNewElementArray.forEach.backgroundcolor = "grey";
}

doSomethingButton.onmouseleave = function(){
myNewElementArray.forEach(function(element){
element.style.backgroundcolor = "white";
});
}

window setTimeout for countdown maybe


for css adding class
myNewElement.classlist.add("element");



to add to a specific list, they must first be set in html, because I CANNOT BE FUCKED!.

They will need to be in their own div, that stretches the whole page.
Each should be spread evenly and centred 30% should do it.






click power 10x
if cookies > 150 by upgrade
adds 1 click every 1secs

if cookies > 1000 by unpgrade 2
double click power

this will be enough

setTimeout

Set Timeinterval

uses function so that once parameter(time) is done, an action(the function) is taken.
Will be very useful for cookie click upgrades.

each setTimeout and set interval has an indexthat can be used to stop or clear it


will need to get the page to display changing cookies per second.

set interval(function) {

cookies += 1;
doument.getElementbyID("elements").innerhtml = cookies;
console.log(cookies or something)
innerhtml is removes whatever was there before, nothing can remain. Avoid doing this where things need to be remember.
}

what is the html framework set up
width and height reletive.


The real game consists of 5 seperated div sections, 3 main sections and 2 dividers

15px wide for deviders btw
the other sections can look however you like

Left section: needs Giant cookie and cookies count and cookies per second, also a name at the top



Comments up top
devider in between


Big maybe
maybe for middle section, you can just add goofy picks like cookie fields
all of them would have the same class but different ids
maybe 2 will do

Create the comments section to cycle between 10 or so messages, to make it more interesting for lochi to look at. You may need to use the random switch generator for it, with interval time for automatic swaping. maybe an onclick too.


Right section
Needs the upgrades

the 2 or 3 upgrades

maybe one building MAYBE
