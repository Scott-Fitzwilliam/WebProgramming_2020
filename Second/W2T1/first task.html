            <h1>Hi Stranger,</h1>
            <p>Hi there, are you interested in getting good grades 
                and looking like you know what your doing
                without admitting you have no idea what's happening? 
                Well you're in luck, with this one, unnecessary,
                questionablely useful and most importantly expensive 
                online class, you'll learn all of the basic noob coding
                so that when you actually go and study, you'll manage. 
                So come on down and click the link that definitely isn't the
                equivalent of an ATM eating your credit card :P
            </p>

            <div class="button">
